# Origami

This is an Augmented Reality (AR) application used to test the Hololens (you can use the Emulator if you don't have a real device).
This project is based on the [Microsoft Academy course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms-101e), but the course is a little outdated, so I am using the latest HoloTooKit available today (September, 2018) and making the appropriate adjustments.

## Features

In this scene we can test

* **Gaze**
* **Gestures** (on the spheres, press Button A in Xbox Controller, Space on the keyboard, or the pinch zoom with the real device)

## Tools

* Unity 2018.2.6f1
* [HoloToolKit 2017.4.1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) (already on this project)
* Visual Studio 2017
* [Hololens emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator) (or the Hololens device itself)

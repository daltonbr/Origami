# Origami

This is an Augmented Reality (AR) application used to test the Hololens (you can use the Emulator if you don't have a real device).
This project is based on the [Microsoft Academy course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms-101e), but the course is a little outdated, so I am using the latest HoloTooKit available today (September, 2018) and making the appropriate adjustments.

## Features

In this scene we can test

* **Gaze** - a cursor that mimics the one in the Hololens.
* **Gestures** - when gazing on the spheres, press _Button A_ in Xbox Controller, _Space Bar_ on the keyboard, or make the _pinch_ with your hand using the real Hololens
* **Voice input** you can say "Drop" (when gazing over a sphere) or "Reset" any time to reset the scene.

## Tools

* Unity 2018.2.6f1
* [HoloToolKit 2017.4.1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) (already on this project)
* Visual Studio 2017
* [Hololens emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator) (or the Hololens device itself)
